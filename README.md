## Objective

The goal of this MySQL project is to design and implement a structured relational database to efficiently store, manage, and query data. This project aims to demonstrate the power of SQL in handling complex data operations, ensuring data integrity, and delivering meaningful insights through queries.
### Database Design:
Created a relational database with well-defined tables, relationships, and constraints (e.g., primary keys, foreign keys) to ensure data integrity and reduce redundancy.
### Data Ingestion:
Imported data from various sources like CSV files, Excel sheets, or APIs into MySQL tables.
### SQL Queries:
Developed complex SQL queries using SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING, and subqueries to extract insights from the database.
### Data Manipulation:
Used INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE statements to manage and modify data efficiently.
### Optimization:
Enhanced query performance by implementing indexes, views, and stored procedures for faster data retrieval.
